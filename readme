  Ludacm is a game created in a professional training project in 2017 by Marc Harnist.
  The target of the game is to teach boring law to students. 
  It's a multiple choice using mysql where are questions and answers.
  It's simple for a webdevelopper senior, but I'm just learning.
  I learn OOP and MVC and try to use them in this project.
  Thanks to all friends who will review my work.
